step1:start
step2:declare the variable i=1,sum,n
step3:assign the value sum=0,n=10,i=1
step4:calculate the variable sum=sum+i
step5:and increment the value i=i+1
step6:if(i<=10) then repeat the step4 and step5
step7:dispaly the sum
step8:stop



algorithm for even numbers 1 to 100
step1:start
step2:declare the variables i to 1
step3:check the value is less than or equal to 100(i<=100)
step4:if the i divided by 2 and it is equal to 0(i%2=0)
step5:print even number
step6:increment the value by 1 repeat step4&step5
step7:stop


algorithm for odd numbers 1 to 100
step1:start
step2:declare the value i to 1
step3:check the value is lessthan or equal to 100(i<=100)
step4: if the i divided by 2 and it is not equal to 0(i%2!=0)
step5:print odd number
step6:increment the value by 1 repeat step4&step5
step7:stop
