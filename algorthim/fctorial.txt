step1: start
step2:input a number
step3:to assign i=1
step4: to check i is less than equal input number or not if i is less than equal number then goto step number 5
otherwise goto step8
step5: to check input number is divisible by ior not
step6:if the number is divisble by i then print the value of i as a factor otherwise go to step7
step7:to increase the value of i by1
step8: stop

step1: start
step2: declare n
step3: intialize i=1,n=8
step4: if n%i==0 if it is tru go to step5 if not go to step6
step5: print i
step6: i=i+1
step7:repeat the step5 and step6 until i<=n otherwise go to step8
step8: stop

Algorithm to print the factorial of 15
step 1: start
step 2: declare a variable i, n
step 3: assign the value i=1 ,n=15 
step 4: check that the i value is less than or equal to n
step 5: if the i value is less than and equal to n then go to step 6 or otherwise go to step10
step 6: check i value is divisible by n or not 
step 7:if the i is divisible by n 
step 8: then print the value of i is a factor of n otherwise go to step 9
step 9:to increase the value of i by 1 until it satisfies the condition (i<=n)
step10 : stop

perfect number:
step1: start
step2: read n
step3: initialize s=0
step4: for i=1 to n
if (n%i)==0
s=s+i
i=i+1
step5:if s==n
then print given number s perfect number,goto step7
step6:print given numb is not a perfect number
step7:stop
